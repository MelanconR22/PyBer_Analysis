# PyBer_Analysis  - Use the PyBer ipynb file to use additional chart info

## Overview of the analysis:

PyBer is a Python based ride sharing app company and I have been fortunate enough to start a new role with the company.  My first project is to analyze ride sharing data and recommend ways to improve access and affordability of rides and drive profitability of the company.

## Results:
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type

compare results and talk about how urban has most drivers and number of rides but produces smallest fares due to shorter distances
suburban is middle of the road
rural produces most fares but has the smallest number of rides and makes sense due to longer distances

## Summary:
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

market to rural and suburban areas in case they don't know about services

analyze cities that have the most routes and put more drivers in the area to not miss opportunities

identify cities that have the most rides and identify the reason or need for the rides 

identify events that cause spikes in fares
